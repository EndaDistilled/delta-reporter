It's a real game changer in terms of test maintenance experience, with all the data gathered in one place. It can be used by any member of tech team, as it's providing a lot of add-on features to suit all needs. The goals of this project are: Monitor all the automated tests involved on a software development flow in real time Keep an history of the results on previous deployments Automated comparison with older results to suggest type of failure (application change, test to be updated, platform issue) Start using Delta Reporter There are few main steps to get the Delta Reporter running for your team.

This page contains information on how to set Delta Reporter locally for development purposes. This is the main Delta repository: https://github.com/delta-reporter/delta-reporter.git Local dev deployment To start with, clone main delta repository (preferably in your root folder create a folder called \"delta-local\" and clone it there) git clone https://github.com/delta-reporter/delta-reporter.git All the files needed for local deployment are located in /dev folder. In the delta-reporter/dev/ folder you will find a script to easily clone all the other repositories of the project (core and frontend repos) cd dev && ./clone_services.sh Or do it manually: - Core https://github.com/delta-reporter/delta-core.git - Frontend https://github.com/delta-reporter/delta-frontend.git After cloning the repos, you have the option to let the script build the images from each repo You might need to go to /delta-frontend/ and run npm install to have all the dependencies ready. Since the application is dockerized, it can be deployed easily with Docker Compose. To spin up the application simply run the following commands from your /delta-reporter/dev/ folder docker-compose build && docker-compose up Before you start using Delta Reporter, you'll need to initialize the database and some default values, please follow the instructions below. Database Before start using Delta Reporter, you'll need to initialize the database and some default values, do this with this command: docker exec delta_core_dev python manage.py db upgrade This command run the scripts located in migrations/versions/ in order to apply the changes on the database Then, to load default values, send a POST request to the endpoint /api/v1/initial_setup by running: curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/initial_setup If no errors are met, the environment should be ready on: http://localhost:3000 Generating test data To be able to work with delta, you will need some test data in your database. In order to generate the data, you will need to clone one of our test clients (testNG, PHPUnit or wdio) and run the tests. Note, Delta Reporter should be up and running, when you do so. For example: Clone TestNG client plugin https://github.com/delta-reporter/delta-reporter-testng.git Install maven, if you don't have it on your local machine https://www.appsdeveloperblog.com/how-to-install-maven-on-mac-os/ Go to that /delta-reporter-testng/ folder and run the tests mvn clean test -Dsurefire.suiteXmlFiles=suites/TestSuite1.xml Useful information http://localhost:3000/ | Delta Frontend Service http://localhost:5000/ | Delta Core Service The server will restart automatically on any change in the code To stop the server at any stage use docker-compose stop","title":"Local Deployment for development"},{"location":"dev_deployment/#local-deployment-for-development","text":"Docker Compose can be used to deploy all Delta services and perform real time changes.
